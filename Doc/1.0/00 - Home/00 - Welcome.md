# 👋 Welcome to SOMADoc!

Thank you for choosing SOMADoc — your powerful documentation framework!

You’re seeing this page because the `Doc` folder is still empty or hasn’t been customized yet.

## 🚀 How to get started

To begin creating your documentation:

1. Add your Markdown files inside the `Doc` folder.
2. Follow the folder and file naming convention to maintain proper order and structure:

```
Doc/
├─ VERSION/
│ ├─ 00 - CATERGORY 1/
│ │ └─ 00 - PAGE 1.md
│ ├─ 01 - CATERGORY 2/
│ │ └─ 00 - PAGE 2.md
│ └─ ...
└─ ...
```

- Use two-digit prefixes (`00`, `01`, ..., `99`) to control the order of your folders and files.
- Folder and file names should include a descriptive title after the digits.

Once your Markdown files are in place and organized, SOMADoc will automatically generate your documentation site — ready to explore!
